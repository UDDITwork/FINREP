# Zoom RTMS Migration Feasibility Analysis Report

**Project**: FINREP Meeting Service Migration from Daily.co to Zoom RTMS  
**Date**: August 4, 2025  
**Status**: Feasibility Assessment Complete  

---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of the current Daily.co implementation and research into Zoom Real-Time Media Streams (RTMS), **this migration is technically feasible but comes with significant implementation challenges and architectural differences**. The current sophisticated Daily.co integration can be replicated with Zoom RTMS, but requires substantial development effort and a different approach to meeting management.

### Key Findings:
- ✅ **Technically Feasible**: Zoom RTMS can provide equivalent functionality
- ⚠️ **High Complexity**: Requires complete rewrite of meeting infrastructure  
- ⚠️ **Different Architecture**: WebSocket-based vs REST API approach
- ✅ **Enhanced Features**: Better transcription accuracy and compliance features
- ⚠️ **Development Timeline**: Estimated 8-12 weeks for full migration

## Migration Feasibility Assessment

### ✅ **FEASIBLE ASPECTS**

#### 1. Core Meeting Functionality
- **Meeting Creation**: Can use Zoom Meeting SDK for room creation
- **Video/Audio**: Full video conferencing capabilities via Zoom
- **Participant Management**: WebSocket events for join/leave tracking
- **Screen Sharing**: Native Zoom screen sharing support

#### 2. Transcription Capabilities
- **Real-time Transcripts**: WebSocket streaming provides live transcription
- **Speaker Identification**: Zoom RTMS includes user name in transcript data
- **Storage**: Can maintain current MongoDB transcript schema
- **Export**: Can continue providing downloadable transcripts

#### 3. Database Schema Compatibility
Current `Meeting.js` schema can be adapted:
```javascript
// Enhanced schema for Zoom RTMS
transcript: {
  status: ['not_started', 'active', 'completed', 'error'],
  zoomSessionId: String, // Zoom RTMS session ID
  webSocketUrl: String, // RTMS WebSocket endpoint
  streamIds: [String], // Multiple stream identifiers
  realTimeMessages: [{
    timestamp: Date,
    participantId: String,
    participantName: String, // From Zoom user data
    text: String,
    messageType: Number, // Zoom RTMS message type
    confidence: Number
  }],
  // ... existing fields remain compatible
}
```

#### 4. Email & Client Workflow
- **Meeting Links**: Can generate Zoom meeting URLs
- **Client Onboarding**: Integration workflow remains similar
- **Automated Emails**: SMTP service unchanged

### ⚠️ **CHALLENGING ASPECTS**

#### 1. Frontend Architecture Overhaul
**Current**: Daily.co React components with hooks
```javascript
// Current - Simple Daily.co integration
import { DailyProvider, useDaily, useDailyEvent } from '@daily-co/daily-react';
const daily = useDaily();
useDailyEvent('transcription-message', handleTranscript);
```

**Required**: Custom WebSocket management + Zoom SDK
```javascript
// Required - Complex WebSocket + SDK integration
import ZoomMtgEmbedded from '@zoomus/websdk/embedded';
// + Custom WebSocket connections for RTMS
// + Manual event handling and state management
```

#### 2. Real-time Transcription Complexity
**Current**: Automatic Daily.co event handling
**Required**: Manual WebSocket connection management
- Multiple WebSocket connections (signaling + media)
- HMAC signature authentication
- Message type parsing and routing
- Connection resilience and reconnection logic

#### 3. Meeting Room UI Complete Rewrite
- **Video Layout**: Must build custom video grid with Zoom SDK
- **Controls**: Custom audio/video/screen sharing controls
- **Transcript Panel**: Manual WebSocket message aggregation
- **Recording**: Zoom Cloud Recording API integration

#### 4. Authentication Complexity
**Current**: Simple token-based access
**Required**: Complex signature-based authentication
- HMAC SHA256 signature generation
- Meeting UUID and stream ID management
- Webhook signature verification
- Multiple authentication contexts

### ❌ **MAJOR TECHNICAL CHALLENGES**

#### 1. No Direct React Component Library
- Daily.co provides `@daily-co/daily-react` with ready-made components
- Zoom RTMS requires building everything from scratch
- Significant UI/UX development effort required

#### 2. WebSocket Connection Management
- Must handle multiple concurrent WebSocket connections
- Complex handshake and authentication process
- Error handling and reconnection logic
- State synchronization across connections

#### 3. Meeting SDK Integration Complexity
- Requires Zoom Meeting SDK for core video functionality
- RTMS is an additional layer on top of Zoom meetings
- Two separate integration points to maintain

#### 4. Limited Documentation & Examples
- Zoom RTMS documentation is less comprehensive than Daily.co
- Fewer community examples and troubleshooting resources
- More experimental platform compared to Daily.co

## Recommendation

### ✅ **RECOMMENDED APPROACH: PHASED MIGRATION**

**The migration is technically feasible but requires significant planning and resources.**

#### Immediate Actions (Next 4 weeks):
1. **Proof of Concept**: Build minimal RTMS integration to validate approach
2. **Resource Planning**: Allocate dedicated development team
3. **Zoom Partnership**: Establish relationship with Zoom for technical support
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Plan for parallel operation during transition

#### Success Criteria:
- Maintain all current functionality
- Improve transcription accuracy by 15%+
- Zero downtime migration for existing clients
- User experience equivalent or better than current system

#### Alternative Recommendation:
If development resources are limited, consider **keeping Daily.co** and adding Zoom RTMS as an optional premium feature for enterprise clients who specifically request native Zoom integration.

## Conclusion

**The migration from Daily.co to Zoom RTMS is technically feasible but represents a significant undertaking.** The current Daily.co integration is sophisticated and well-implemented, providing excellent user experience with minimal complexity. 

Zoom RTMS offers superior transcription capabilities and enterprise integration, but requires building much of the functionality from scratch. The decision should be made based on:

1. **Strategic Importance**: How critical is native Zoom integration for your target market?
2. **Resource Availability**: Can you allocate 3-4 months of dedicated development time?
3. **Risk Tolerance**: Are you prepared for potential temporary disruption to user experience?

**Recommendation**: Proceed with a small proof-of-concept to validate the technical approach before committing to full migration.
